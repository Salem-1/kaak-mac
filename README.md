# kaak-troll-for-mac
I added the kaak and student kaak to this work, however the original program belongs to https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQx6fyrZDWM)

To run the troll:

git clone https://github.com/Salem-1/kaak-troll-for-mac.git
```
  cd kaak-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22
  screen -d -m "./kaak &"
```
or
```
  cd kaak-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22
  screen -d -m ./student_kaak &
```
or 
```
  mv kaak-mac ~/. ;
  cd ;
  echo "open kaak-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22/Desktop\ Goose.app &" >> .zshrc;
  echo 'alias shutup="kill \" \$(pgrep Goose | tail -1)\""' >> .zshrc
```
to stop the troll go to the same directory as before
  ```
  cd kaak-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22
  ./shut_up &
```

Don't forget to Increase the volume to the Max :)
