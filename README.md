# kaak-troll-for-mac
I added the kaak and student kaak to this work, however the original program belongs to https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQx6fyrZDWM)

This is pure education project, I hold no responsability for running this code or the consequences based on it.
To run the troll:
run this command in your terminal
```
  git clone https://github.com/Salem-1/kaak-mac.git  && cd kaak-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22/Desktop   && ./kaak
```
