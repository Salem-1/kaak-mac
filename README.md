# kaak-troll-for-mac
I added the kaak and student kaak to this work, however the original program belongs to https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQx6fyrZDWM)

To run the troll:

git clone https://github.com/Salem-1/kaak-troll-for-mac.git
```
  cd kaak-troll-for-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22
  ./kaak &
```
or
```
  ./student_kaak &
```
to stop the troll go to the same directory as before
  ```
  cd kaak-troll-for-mac/Desktop\ Goose\ for\ Mac\ v0.22
  ./shut_up &
```
